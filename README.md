# Roger

This is School 42 Roger-skyline-1 Project.

This project includes creation of Debian virtual machine, setting of ssh-connection, UFW setting, fail2ban & iptables setting, port scan defence (Portsentry) setting, crontab setting, installation and setting of Nginx web-server, acquisition and installation of self-signed SSL.

Here you can find some of the steps to setup the VM (UFW, fail2ban, iptables, portsentry, crontab) and deploy an application on a web-server (I used Nginx).

The tasks you can find in roger-skyline-1.5.en.pdf.
